# MSc individual research project code
This is the code for my final dissertation of "Semi-supervised video segmentation in endoscopic pituitary surgery" in UCL

And since the trainning weights for each fold is too big so I just upload them on the onedrive where you can find at: https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ucabhxu_ucl_ac_uk/EmugnbE36B5CkKVNXt9c_7IB_B1FwRONiqQ71JDukfMDoQ?e=Jcibai 

In the folder, the `weights0` - `weights4` represent the 5 fold of the 5-fold cross validation, inside each weights, the `exp0` represent the result of our model + EMA, 
`exp1` represent our model, `exp2` represent the fine tune.
